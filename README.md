# CHATBOT

This is a simple **console-based Chatbot** developed in **Java**. It interacts with users through predefined responses to greetings, questions, fun facts, and jokes. Designed with modular code and condition-based logic, this project demonstrates core programming and string handling techniques in Java.

Features

- Greets users and handles common conversation starters
- Tells random fun facts or jokes
- Uses conditional statements to manage dialogue flow
- Clean, readable, and modular Java code
- Fast response with minimal system load


Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8+)
- IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code (any Java-supporting IDE)
- Scanner for input
- Console for interaction


Concepts Applied

- Conditional Logic (`if-else`, `switch`)
- Loops and Input Handling
- String Matching and Manipulation
- Object-Oriented Programming (if modularized)
- Code modularization for clarity

Bot: Hello! How can I assist you today?

You: Tell me a joke.

Bot: Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't C#.

You: Bye

Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day!
